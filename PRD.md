## Design Direction
The design should feel professional yet approachable, like a developer documentation site with personality - clean, modern, and trustworthy while maintaining visual interest through code examples and live previews.

## Color Selection
Complementary (opposite colors) - Using GitHub's signature colors as inspiration with blue and orange accents to create a developer-focused yet vibrant interface.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.35 0.15 250)) - Represents trust, professionalism, and GitHub's brand identity
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays (oklch(0.95 0 0) to oklch(0.2 0 0)) - For text hierarchy and backgrounds
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.7 0.2 45)) - For CTAs, highlights, and interactive elements to create energy
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0 0)) - Ratio 15.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.35 0.15 250)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Orange oklch(0.7 0.2 45)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray oklch(0.98 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0 0)) - Ratio 14.1:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Modern, developer-friendly typography that balances readability for documentation with personality for marketing content - using Inter for UI and JetBrains Mono for code.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Subsections): Inter Medium/20px/normal spacing
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Code Inline: JetBrains Mono Regular/14px/normal spacing
  - Code Blocks: JetBrains Mono Regular/13px/generous line height

## Animations
Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance the developer experience - smooth transitions for state changes and gentle hover effects that feel responsive without being distracting.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion reinforces the professional, modern feeling while providing clear feedback for interactive elements
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Code previews and template generation get priority animation focus as core features

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Cards for demo showcases, Tabs for code/preview switching, Dialog for template generation, Accordion for FAQ/troubleshooting, Button variants for different action types, Badge for tags/categories
- **Customizations**: Custom syntax highlighter component, Template configurator with multi-step form
- **States**: Buttons show loading states during generation, Cards have hover elevations, Code blocks have copy-success feedback
- **Icon Selection**: GitHub, Code, Copy, Download, External Link, CheckCircle, AlertTriangle icons
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4/8/16/24/32px spacing scale with generous whitespace around code blocks
- **Mobile**: Responsive grid that stacks cards vertically, collapsible navigation, touch-optimized interactive elements
